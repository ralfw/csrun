# csrun - A Simple Console Runner for C#

There are a lot of REPL tools for running C# interactively. You might even be able to do that right in your IDE, e.h. JetBrains Rider.

The purpose of such tools is to explore the language and to spike small solutions. It's is not an educational purpose.

However, education would benefit from a more simplified coding experience. Confronting a beginner of C# (or even programming) with a massive tool like Visual Studio or Rider is counter productive. She will find it hard to get done what's on her mind. Important features for the moment are hidden among a flurry of irrelevant features.

Enter: csrun
